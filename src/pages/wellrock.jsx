        This project showcases my ability to design and customize an intuitive
        e-commerce platform tailored for CNC tools and accessories. As part of a
        business venture with my brother, I utilized Shopify to create a
        storefront that highlights our expanding product catalog, including
        stone-cutting tools, polishing pads, diamond saws, and lifting clamps.
        My role focused on enhancing the user experience with a modern and
        visually appealing design while ensuring functionality and ease of
        navigation.

      <p className="project-description">
        Leveraging Shopify's platform, I incorporated custom CSS to refine the
        interface and optimize the layout for desktop and mobile users. The
        design emphasizes clarity and professionalism, providing customers with
        a seamless shopping experience. Despite using a pre-built platform, I
        ensured the front-end visuals reflected a cohesive brand identity,
        maintaining a clean, industrial aesthetic.
      </p>
      <p className="project-description">
        Beyond development, I contributed to business strategy by analyzing
        potential clientele and market needs, shaping the product lineup and
        launch approach. This analytical work informed the design and
        functionality choices, aligning the storefront with customer
        expectations.

      <p className="project-description">
        The e-commerce site is not only a functional store but also a testament
        to my ability to blend UI/UX principles with business acumen, creating a
        platform thatâ€™s both effective and engaging.
